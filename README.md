# NYCtrees
Here we produced an individual tree dataset including tree locations, height, crown area, crown volume, and biomass over the entire New York City, USA for 6,005,690 trees. Individual trees were detected and mapped from remotely sensed datasets along with their height and crown size information. 
The individual tree attributes and location dataset were calculated from airborne LiDAR data and land cover maps from NAIP aerial imagery using SAGA GIS and ArcGIS software. The table for individual tree attributes (NYTrees_FID_Region_Att.csv) can be found in this website  https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Trees_in_New_York_City/20522895/2?file=38666738.
